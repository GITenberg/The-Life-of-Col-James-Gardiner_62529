<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Colonel James Gardiner</span> was the son
of Captain Patrick Gardiner, who served many years in the armies
of King William and Queen Anne, and died abroad with the British
forces in Germany.</p>
<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s mother was a lady of very excellent
character; but it pleased God to exercise her with uncommon
trials; for she lost not only her husband and her brother in the
service of their country, but also her eldest son, Mr. R.
Gardiner, on the day which completed his sixteenth year, at the
siege of Namur, in 1695.&nbsp; But God blessed these afflictions
as the means of forming her to an eminent degree of piety.</p>
<p>The second son, the subject of this Memoir, was born in
Linlithgowshire, Jan. 10, 1687&ndash;8, the memorable year of the
glorious Revolution, in defence of which his own life was
eventually sacrificed.</p>
<p>In early life, his mother took care to instruct him with great
tenderness and affection in the principles of true
Christianity.&nbsp; While at the school at Linlithgow, he made a
considerable progress in literature.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>In the
younger part of his life the good effects of his mother&rsquo;s
prudent and exemplary care were not so conspicuous as she hoped;
yet there is great reason to believe they were not entirely
lost.&nbsp; Could she have prevailed, he would not have thought
of a military life; but it suited his taste; and the ardour of
his spirit, animated by the persuasions of a friend, who greatly
urged it, was not to be restrained.&nbsp; Nor will the reader
wonder at this, when he knows that this lively youth fought three
duels before he attained the stature of a man; in one of which,
when but eight years old, he received from a boy, much older than
himself, a wound in the right cheek, the scar of which was always
very apparent.&nbsp; This false sense of honour might seem
excusable in those unripened years, and considering the
profession of his father; but he often mentioned it with
regret.&nbsp; And after his conversion, he declined accepting a
challenge, with this truly great reply, which in a man of his
experienced bravery was exceedingly to be admired, &ldquo;I fear
sinning,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though you know I do not fear
fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He served as a cadet very early: and at fourteen years old, he
bore an ensign&rsquo;s commission in a Scotch regiment in the
Dutch service; in which he continued till 1702, when he received
an ensign&rsquo;s commission from Queen Anne, which he bore in
the battle of Ramilies, in his nineteenth year.</p>
<p>On this occasion, our young officer was commanded on what
seemed almost a desperate service, to dispossess the French of
the church-yard at Ramilies, where a considerable number of them
were posted to remarkable advantage.&nbsp; They succeeded better
than was expected, and Mr. G. was glad of such an opportunity of
signalizing himself.&nbsp; Accordingly, he had planted his
colours on an advanced ground, and while he was calling to the
men (probably in that horrid language which is so peculiar a
disgrace to our soldiery) he received a shot in his <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>mouth, which,
without beating out any of his teeth, or touching the forepart of
his tongue, went through his neck.&nbsp; Not feeling at first the
pain of the stroke, he wondered what was become of the ball, and
in the wildness of his surprise began to suspect he had swallowed
it; but dropping soon after, he traced the passage of it by his
finger, when he could discover it no other way.</p>
<p>This accident happened about five or six in the evening, on
the 23d of May, in the year 1706; and the army pursuing its
advantages against the French, without regarding the wounded, our
young officer lay all night in the field, agitated, as may well
be supposed, with a great variety of thoughts.&nbsp; When he
reflected upon the circumstances of his wound, that a ball
should, as he then conceived it, go through his head without
killing him, he thought God had preserved him by a miracle; and
therefore assuredly concluded, that he should live, abandoned and
desperate as his condition then seemed.&nbsp; Yet had he little
thought of humbling himself before God, and returning to Him
after the wanderings of a life licentiously begun.&nbsp; But,
expecting to recover, his mind was taken up with contrivances to
secure his gold, of which he had nearly twenty pistoles about
him; and he had recourse to a very odd expedient.&nbsp; Expecting
to be stripped, he took out a handful of clotted gore, of which
he was frequently obliged to clear his mouth; and putting it into
his left hand, he took out the money, and shutting his hand,
besmeared the back of it with blood; in this position he kept it
till the blood so dried, that his hand could not easily fall
open.</p>
<p>In the morning, the French, who were masters of that spot,
though defeated at some distance, came to plunder the slain, and
seeing him to appearance almost expiring, one of them was just
applying a sword to his breast to destroy the little remainder of
life; when, in the critical moment, a cordelier, who <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>attended them,
interposed, taking him by his dress for a Frenchman, and said,
&ldquo;Do not kill the poor child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our young soldier
heard all that passed, though he was not able to speak one word;
and opening his eyes made a sign for something to drink.&nbsp;
They gave him a sup of some spirituous liquor, which happened to
be at hand; from which he said he derived a more sensible
refreshment than he could remember from any thing he had tasted
either before or since.&nbsp; Then, asking, by signs, the friar
to lean down his ear to his mouth, he employed the first efforts
of his feeble breath in telling him (what, alas! was a contrived
falsehood) that he was nephew to the governor of Huy, a neutral
town in the neighbourhood, and that, if they could convey him
thither, he did not doubt but his uncle would liberally reward
them.&nbsp; He had indeed a friend there, but the relationship
was pretended.&nbsp; However, on hearing this, they laid him on a
sort of hand-barrow, and sent him with a file of musketeers
towards the place; but the men lost their way, and got into a
wood towards the evening, in which they were obliged to continue
all night.&nbsp; The poor patient&rsquo;s wound being still
undressed, it is not to be wondered at, that by this time it
raged violently.&nbsp; The anguish of it engaged him earnestly to
beg that they would either kill him outright, or leave him there
to die, without the torture of any other motion; and indeed they
were obliged to rest for a considerable time on account of their
own weariness.&nbsp; Thus he spent the second night in the open
air, without any thing more than a common bandage to stanch the
blood; and he often mentioned it as a most astonishing
providence, that he did not bleed to death.</p>
<p>Judging it quite unsafe to attempt carrying him to Huy, whence
they were now several miles distant, his convoy took him early in
the morning to a convent in the neighbourhood; where he was
hospitably received, and treated with great kindness and
tenderness.&nbsp; <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>But the cure of his wound was committed to an ignorant
barber-surgeon, who lived near the house.&nbsp; The tent which
this artist applied, was almost like a peg driven into the wound;
yet, by the blessing of God, he recovered in a few months.&nbsp;
The lady abbess, who called him her son treated him with the
affection and care of a mother.&nbsp; He received a great many
devout admonitions from the ladies there, and they would fain
have persuaded him to acknowledge so miraculous a deliverance, by
embracing the <i>Catholic Faith</i>, as they were pleased to call
it.&nbsp; But, though no religion lay near his heart, he had too
much the spirit of a gentleman, lightly to change that form of
religion which he wore loose about him.</p>
<p>When his liberty was regained by an exchange of prisoners, and
his health established, he was far from rendering to the Lord
according to the mercy he had experienced.&nbsp; Very little is
known of the particulars of those wild and thoughtless years
which lay between the nineteenth and thirtieth of his life;
except that he experienced the divine goodness in preserving him
in several hot military actions; and yet these years were spent
in an entire alienation from God, and an eager pursuit of sensual
pleasure as his supreme good.</p>
<p>Amidst all these wanderings from religion, virtue, and
happiness, he approved himself so well in his military character,
that he was made a lieutenant in 1708; and, after several
intermediate promotions, appointed major of a regiment commanded
by the Earl of Stair.&nbsp; In January, 1729&ndash;30, he was
advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the same regiment:
and here continued till April, 1743; when he received a
colonel&rsquo;s commission over a regiment of dragoons; and at
the head of which he valiantly fell about two years and a half
after he received it.</p>
<p>We now return to that period of his life which passed at
Paris, where he resided in the family of the <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Earl of Stair,
with some interruptions, till about the year 1720.</p>
<p>The Earl&rsquo;s favour and generosity made him easy in his
affairs, though he was part of the time out of commission, the
regiment to which he belonged being disbanded.&nbsp; This was, in
all probability, the gayest part of his life, and the most
criminal.&nbsp; Whatever good examples he might find in the
family where he lived, it is certain that the French court was
one of the most dissolute under heaven.&nbsp; What, by a wretched
abuse of language, have been called intrigues of love and
gallantry, constituted, if not the whole business, at least the
whole pleasure of his life: his fine constitution, than which,
perhaps, there was hardly ever a better, gave him great
opportunities of indulging himself in those excesses; and his
good spirits enabled him to pursue his pleasures in such a
manner, that multitudes envied him, and called him, by a dreadful
kind of compliment, &ldquo;The happy rake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the checks of conscience, and some remaining principles of
so good an education, would break in upon his most licentious
hours; and when some of his dissolute companions were once
congratulating him upon his felicity, a dog happening at that
time to come into the room, he could not forbear groaning
inwardly, and saying to himself, &ldquo;O that I were that
dog!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was then his happiness, and such perhaps
is that of hundreds more, who bear themselves highest in the
contempt of religion, and glory in that infamous servitude, which
they affect to call liberty.</p>
<p>Yet in the most abandoned days, he was never fond of
intemperate drinking, from which he used to think a manly pride
might be sufficient to preserve persons of sense and spirit; so
that if he ever fell into any excesses of that kind, it was
merely out of complaisance.&nbsp; His frank, obliging, and
generous temper, procured him many friends; and those principles,
which rendered him amiable to others, not <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>being under the
direction of wisdom and piety, sometimes made him more uneasy to
himself than he perhaps might have been if he could entirely have
outgrown them, especially as he was never a confirmed sceptic,
but still retained a secret apprehension, that natural and
revealed religion was founded in truth.&nbsp; With this
conviction, his notorious violation of the most essential
precepts of both, could not but occasion some secret misgivings
of heart.</p>
<p>His continual neglect of the great Author of his being, to
whom he knew himself to be under daily and perpetual obligations,
gave him, in some moments of involuntary reflection,
inexpressible remorse; and this, at times, wrought upon him to
such a degree, that he resolved he would attempt to pay Him some
acknowledgments.&nbsp; Accordingly, for a few mornings he did it;
repeating in retirement some passages out of the Psalms, and
other Scriptures, which he still retained in his memory; and
owning, in a few strong words, the many mercies and deliverances
he had received, and the ill-returns he had made for them.</p>
<p>But these strains were too devout to continue long in a heart
as yet unsanctified: for how readily soever he could repeat such
acknowledgments of the divine power and goodness, and confess his
own follies and faults, he was stopt short by the remonstrances
of his conscience, as to the flagrant absurdity of confessing
sins he did not desire to forsake, and of pretending to praise
God for his mercies, when he did not endeavour to live to his
service.&nbsp; A model of devotion, where such sentiments made no
part, his good sense could not digest; and the use of such
language before a heart-searching God merely as a hypocritical
form, while the sentiments of his soul were contrary to it,
appeared to him such daring profaneness, that, irregular as the
state of his mind was, the thought of it struck him with
horror.&nbsp; He therefore determined to make no more attempts of
this sort; and was one of the first that deliberately laid <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>aside prayer,
from some sense of God&rsquo;s omniscience, and some natural
principle of honour and conscience.</p>
<p>These secret debates with himself and ineffectual efforts
would sometimes return: but they were overborne, again and again,
by the force of temptation; and it is no wonder, that in
consequence of them his heart grew still harder.&nbsp; Neither
was it softened, or awakened, by the very memorable deliverances,
which at this time he received.&nbsp; Once he was in extreme
danger by a fall from his horse.&nbsp; As he was riding fast down
a hill, the horse threw him over his head, and pitched over him;
so that when he rose, the beast lay beyond him, and almost
dead.&nbsp; Yet, though he received not the least harm, it made
no serious impression on his mind.&nbsp; In his return from
England in the packet-boat, but a few weeks after the former
accident, a violent storm, that drove them up to Harwich, tossed
them from thence for several hours, in a dark night, on the coast
of Holland; and brought them into such extremity, that the
captain of the vessel urged him to go to prayers immediately if
he ever intended to do it at all; for he concluded they would in
a few minutes be at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; In these
circumstances he did pray, and that very fervently too; and it
was remarkable, that while he was crying to God for deliverance,
the wind fell, and quickly after they arrived at Calais.&nbsp;
But the major was so little affected with what had befallen him,
that, when some of his gay friends, on hearing the story, rallied
him upon the efficacy of his prayers, he excused himself from the
scandal of being thought much in earnest, by saying, &ldquo;that
it was at midnight, an hour when his good mother and aunt were
asleep; or else he should have left that part of the business to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now come to the account of his conversion.&nbsp; This
memorable event happened towards the middle of July, 1719.&nbsp;
The major had spent the evening (which was the Sabbath) in some
gay company, and <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>had an unhappy assignation with a married lady, whom he
was to attend exactly at twelve.&nbsp; The company broke up about
eleven; and he went into his chamber to kill the tedious
hour.&nbsp; It happened that he took up a religious book, (which
his good mother or aunt had, without his knowledge, slipped into
his portmanteau,) called, &ldquo;The Christian Soldier; or Heaven
taken by Storm:&rdquo; written by Mr. Thomas Watson.&nbsp;
Guessing, by the title, that he should find some phrases of his
own profession spiritualized, in a manner which might afford him
some diversion, he resolved to dip into it, but took no serious
notice of any thing he read; and yet while this book was in his
hand, an impression was made upon his mind (perhaps God only
knows how) which drew after it a train of the most important and
happy consequences.</p>
<p>Suddenly he thought he saw an unusual blaze of light fall on
the book, while he was reading, which he at first imagined might
have happened by some accident in the candle.&nbsp; But lifting
up his eyes, he apprehended to his extreme amazement, that there
was before him, as it were suspended in the air, a visible
representation of the Lord <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span> upon the cross, surrounded with a glory; and was
impressed as if a voice, or something equivalent to a voice, had
come to him to this effect: &ldquo;Oh, sinner, did I suffer this
for thee, and are these the returns?&rdquo;&nbsp; But whether
this were an audible voice, or only a strong impression on his
mind equally striking, he did not seem confident, though he
judged it to be the former.&nbsp; Struck with so amazing a
phenomenon, there remained hardly any life in him, so that he
sank down in the arm-chair in which he sat, and continued, (he
knew not exactly how long) insensible, and when he opened his
eyes saw nothing more than usual.</p>
<p>It may be easily supposed he was in no condition to make any
observation upon the time during which he remained insensible;
nor did he throughout all the remainder of the night once
recollect that criminal <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>assignation which had before
engrossed all his thoughts.&nbsp; He arose in a tumult of
passions not to be conceived, and walked to and fro in his
chamber, till he was ready to drop down, in unutterable
astonishment and agony of heart; appearing to himself the vilest
monster in the creation of God, who had all his lifetime been
crucifying Christ afresh by his sins, and now saw, as he
assuredly believed, by a miraculous vision, the horror of what he
had done.&nbsp; With this was connected such a view both of the
majesty and goodness of God as caused him to loathe and abhor
himself, and to &ldquo;repent as in dust and ashes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He immediately gave judgment against himself that he was worthy
of eternal damnation; was astonished that he had not been
immediately struck dead in the midst of his wickedness; and,
(which deserves particular remark,) though he assuredly believed
that he should ere long be in hell, and settled it as a point
with himself for some months, that the wisdom and justice of God
did most necessarily require that such an enormous sinner should
be made an example of everlasting vengeance, and a spectacle, as
such, both to angels and men, so that he hardly durst presume to
pray for pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much from
the fear of hell, though he concluded it must soon be his
portion, as from a sense of that horrible ingratitude he had
shown to the God of his life, and to that blessed Redeemer who
had been, in so affecting a manner, set forth as crucified before
him.</p>
<p>In this view it may naturally be inferred, that he passed the
remainder of the night waking; and he could get but little rest
in several that followed.&nbsp; His mind was continually taken up
in reflecting on the divine purity and goodness; the grace which
had been proposed to him in the gospel, and which he had
rejected; the singular advantages he had enjoyed and abused; and
the many favours of providence he had received; particularly in
rescuing him from so many imminent dangers of death; which he now
saw must <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>have been attended with such dreadful and hopeless
destruction.&nbsp; The privileges of his education, which, he had
so much despised, lay with an almost insupportable weight on his
mind; and the folly of that career of sinful pleasure, which he
had so many years been running with desperate eagerness, filled
him with indignation against himself, and against the great
deceiver, by whom (to use his own phrase) he had been &ldquo;so
wretchedly and scandalously befooled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mind of major Gardiner continued from this remarkable
time, rather more than three months, (but especially the two
first of them,) in as extraordinary a situation as one can well
imagine.&nbsp; He knew nothing of the joys arising from a sense
of pardon; but, on the contrary, for the greater part of that
time, and with very short intervals of hope towards the end of
it, took it for granted, that he must, in all probability,
quickly perish.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he had such a sense of the
evil of sin, the goodness of the Divine Being, and of the
admirable tendency of the Christian Revelation, that he resolved
to spend the remainder of his life, while God continued him out
of hell, in as rational and useful a manner as he could; and to
continue casting himself at the feet of Divine Mercy every day,
and <i>often</i> in a day, if peradventure there might be hope of
pardon, of which all that he could say was, that he did not
absolutely despair.&nbsp; He had at that time such a sense of the
degeneracy of his own heart, that he hardly durst form any
determinate resolution against sin, or pretend to engage himself
by any vow in the presence of God; but was continually crying to
him, that he would deliver him from the bondage of
corruption.&nbsp; He perceived within himself a most surprising
alteration with regard to the dispositions of his heart; so that
though he felt little of the delight of religious duties, he
extremely desired opportunities of being engaged in them; and
those licentious pleasures, which had before been his heaven,
were now absolutely his aversion; and he was grieved to see <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>human nature,
even in those to whom he was a stranger, prostituted to such low
and contemptible pursuits.&nbsp; He therefore exerted his natural
courage in a new kind of combat, and became an open advocate for
religion, in all its principles, so far as he was acquainted with
them, and all its precepts, relating to sobriety, righteousness,
and godliness.&nbsp; Yet he was very desirous and cautious, that
he might not run into an extreme; and made it one of his first
petitions to God, the very day after these amazing impressions
had been wrought in his mind, that he might not be suffered to
behave with such an affected strictness and preciseness, as would
lead others about him into mistaken notions of religion, and
expose it to reproach or suspicion, as if it were an unlovely or
uncomfortable thing.&nbsp; For this reason, he endeavoured to
appear as cheerful in conversation as he conscientiously could;
though in spite of all his precautions, some traces of that deep
inward sense which he had of his guilt and misery would at times
appear.&nbsp; He made no secret of it, however, that his views
were entirely changed, though he concealed the particular
circumstances attending that change.&nbsp; He told his most
intimate companions freely, that he had reflected on the course
of life in which he had so long joined them, and found it to be
folly and madness, unworthy a rational creature, and much more
unworthy persons calling themselves Christians.&nbsp; And he set
up his standard, upon all occasions, against infidelity and vice,
as determinately as ever he planted his colours in the
field.&nbsp; There was at that time in Paris a certain lady who
had imbibed the principles of Deism, and valued herself much upon
being an avowed advocate for them.&nbsp; The major, with his
usual frankness, (though with that politeness which was habitual
to him,) answered like a man who perfectly saw through the
fallacy of her arguments, and was grieved to the heart for her
delusion.&nbsp; On this she challenged him to debate the matter
at large, and to fix upon <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a day for that purpose, when he
should dine with her, attended with any clergyman he might
choose.&nbsp; A sense of duty would not allow him to decline this
challenge: and yet he had no sooner accepted it than he was
thrown into great perplexity and distress, lest being only a
Christian of six weeks old, he should prejudice so good a cause,
by his unskilful manner of defending it.&nbsp; However, he sought
his refuge in earnest and repeated prayers to God, that he would
graciously enable him, on this occasion, to vindicate his truths
in a manner which might carry conviction along with it.&nbsp; He
then endeavoured to marshal the arguments in his own mind, as
well as he could; and apprehending that he could not speak with
so much freedom before a number of persons, especially before
such whose province he might in that case seem to invade, he
waited on the lady alone upon the day appointed.</p>
<p>The major opened the conference with a view of such arguments
of the Christian religion as he had digested in his own mind, to
prove that the apostles were not mistaken themselves, and that
they could not have intended to impose upon us, in the accounts
they give of the grand facts they attest; with the truth of which
facts that of the Christian religion is most apparently
connected.&nbsp; And it was a great encouragement to him to find,
that, unaccustomed as he was to discourses of this nature, he had
an unusual command both of thought and expression; so that he
recollected and uttered every thing as he could have
wished.&nbsp; The lady heard with attention, till he had finished
his design, and waited for her reply.&nbsp; She then produced
some of her objections, which he canvassed in such a manner, that
at length she burst out into tears, allowed the force of his
arguments and replies, and appeared, for some time after, so
deeply impressed with the conversation, that it was observed by
several of her friends: and there is reason to believe that the
impression continued, at <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>least so far as to prevent her from
ever appearing under the character of an unbeliever or a
sceptic.&nbsp; This is only one, among many of the battles he was
almost daily called out to fight in the cause of religion and
virtue.&nbsp; The continued railleries with which he was
received, in almost all companies where he had been most familiar
before, did often distress him beyond measure; so that he
declared, he would much rather have marched up to a battery of
the enemy&rsquo;s cannon than have been obliged, so continually
as he was, to face such artillery as this.&nbsp; But, like a
brave soldier in the first action wherein he is engaged, he
continued resolute, though shuddering at the terror of the
assault; and quickly overcame those impressions, which it is not,
perhaps, in nature wholly to avoid.&nbsp; In a word, he went on,
as every Christian by divine grace may do, till he turned
ridicule and opposition into respect and veneration.</p>
<p>Within about two months after his first memorable change he
began to perceive some secret dawnings of more cheerful
hope&mdash;that, vile as he then saw himself to be, he might
nevertheless obtain mercy through a Redeemer; and at length about
the end of October, 1719, he found all the burden of his mind
taken off at once by the powerful impression of that memorable
scripture upon his mind; (Rom. iii. 25, 26.) &ldquo;Whom God hath
set forth for a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
declare his righteousness for the remission of sins&mdash;that he
might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had used to imagine, that the justice of God required the
damnation of so enormous a sinner, as he saw himself to be; but
now he was made deeply sensible, that the divine justice might be
not only vindicated but glorified, in saving him by the blood of
Jesus, even that blood which cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp; He was
led to see the riches of redeeming love and grace, in such a
manner as not only engaged him, with the utmost pleasure and
confidence, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>to venture his soul upon them; but even swallowed up (as
it were) his whole heart in the returns of love, which, from that
blessed time, became the genuine and delightful principle of
obedience, and animated him, with an enlarged heart, to run the
ways of God&rsquo;s commandments.&nbsp; Thus God was pleased (as
he himself used to speak) in an hour to turn his captivity.&nbsp;
All the terrors of his former state were turned into unutterable
joy.&nbsp; And though the first ecstasies of it afterwards
subsided into a more calm and composed delight; yet were the
impressions so deep and so permanent, that he declared, on the
word of a Christian and a friend, wonderful as it might seem,
that, for about seven years after this, he enjoyed nearly a
heaven upon earth.&nbsp; His soul was almost continually filled
with a sense of the love of God in Christ; so that from the time
of his waking in the morning, his heart was rising to God, and
triumphing in him; and these thoughts attended him through all
the day, till he lay down on his bed again, and a short interval
of sleep (for it was but a very short one that he allowed
himself) invigorated his animal powers for renewing those
thoughts with greater intenseness and sensibility.</p>
<p>A life any thing like this, could not be entered upon, in the
midst of such company as he was obliged to keep, without great
opposition.&nbsp; He, however, early began a practice, which to
the last day of his life he retained, of reproving vice and
profaneness; and was never afraid to debate the matter with any,
under the consciousness of such superiority in the goodness of
his cause.</p>
<p>A remarkable instance of this happened about the middle of the
year 1720, on his first return to make any considerable abode in
England, after his remarkable change.&nbsp; He had heard on the
other side of the water, that it was currently reported among his
companions at home, that he was stark mad: a report at which no
reader, who knows the wisdom <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of the world in these matters will be
much surprised.&nbsp; He hence concluded that he should have many
battles to fight, and was willing to despatch the business as
fast as he could.&nbsp; And, therefore, being to spend a few days
at the country-house of a person of distinguished rank, with whom
he had been very intimate, he begged the favour of him that he
would contrive matters so, that a day or two after he came down,
several of their former gay companions might meet at his
Lordship&rsquo;s table; that he might have an opportunity of
making his apology to them, and acquainting them with the nature
and reasons of his change.&nbsp; It was accordingly agreed to;
and a pretty large company met on the day appointed, with
previous notice that major Gardiner would be there.&nbsp; A good
deal of raillery passed at dinner, to which the major made very
little answer.&nbsp; But when the cloth was taken away, and the
servants had retired, he begged their patience for a few minutes
and then plainly and seriously told them what notions he
entertained of virtue and religion, and on what considerations he
had absolutely determined, that, by the grace of God, he would
make these things the care and business of his life, whatever he
might lose by it, and whatever censure and contempt he might
incur.&nbsp; He well knew how improper it was, in such company,
to relate the extraordinary manner in which he was awakened;
which they would probably have interpreted as a proof of lunacy,
notwithstanding all the gravity and solidity of his discourse;
but he contented himself with such a rational defence of a
righteous, sober and godly life, as he knew none of them could
with any shadow of reason contest.&nbsp; He then challenged them
to propose any thing they could urge to prove that a life of
irreligion and debauchery was preferable to the fear, love, and
worship of the eternal God, and a conduct agreeable to the
precepts of his gospel.&nbsp; And he failed not to bear his
testimony from his own <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>experience, (to one part of which
many of them had been witnesses,) that after having run the round
of sensual pleasure, with all the advantages the best
constitution and spirits could give him, he had never tasted any
thing deserving to be called happiness, till he made religion his
refuge and delight.&nbsp; He testified, calmly and boldly, the
habitual serenity and peace, that he now felt in his own breast,
and the composure and pleasure with which he looked forward to
objects, which the gayest sinner must acknowledge to be equally
unavoidable and dreadful.</p>
<p>Upon this, the master of the table, a person of very frank and
candid disposition, cut short the debate by saying, &ldquo;Come
let us call another cause; we thought this man mad, and he is in
good earnest proving that we are so.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the whole,
this well-judged circumstance saved him a good deal of further
trouble.&nbsp; When his former acquaintances observed that he was
still conversable and innocently cheerful, and that he was
immovable in his resolution, they desisted from further
importunity.&nbsp; And he declared, that, instead of losing one
valuable friend by this change in his character, he found himself
much more esteemed and regarded by many, who could not persuade
themselves to imitate his example.</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable appeared in the Colonel&rsquo;s life from
this period till the year 1726, when he married the Lady Frances
Erskine, daughter to the Earl of Buchan, by whom he had thirteen
children, five of whom survived their father.</p>
<p>Before the close of these short memoirs, it may not be
improper, or without its use, to give the reader a sketch of the
character of this excellent man, with reference to his particular
relative situations; in some or other of which the reader may
certainly find a model worthy of his imitation.</p>
<p>To view him first in the calmness of domestic life, and at the
head of his affectionate family, it will naturally be supposed,
that as soon as he had a house, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>he erected an altar in it; that the
word of God was read there, and prayers and praises constantly
offered.&nbsp; These were not to be omitted on account of any
guest; for he esteemed it a part of due respect to those that
remained under his roof, to take it for granted, they would look
upon it as a very bad compliment, to imagine they would have been
obliged by his neglecting the duties of religion on their
account.&nbsp; As his family increased, he had a minister
statedly resident in his house, who discharged the offices of
tutor and chaplain, and was always treated with kindness and
respect.&nbsp; He was constant in his attendance on public
worship, in which an exemplary care was taken that the children
and servants might accompany the heads of the family.</p>
<p>The necessity of being so many months together distant from
home, hindered him from many of those condescending labours in
cultivating the minds of his children in early life, which to a
soul so benevolent, so wise, and so zealous would undoubtedly
have afforded a very exquisite pleasure: but when he was with
them, he failed not to instruct and admonish them; and the
constant deep sense with which he spoke of divine things, and the
real unaffected indifference which he always showed for what this
vain world is most ready to admire, were daily lessons of wisdom
and of piety.&nbsp; It was easy to perceive, that the openings of
genius in the young branches of his family gave him great
delight, and that he had a secret ambition to see them excel in
what they undertook.&nbsp; Yet he was very jealous over his
heart, lest he should be too fondly attached to them, and was an
eminent proficient in the blessed science of resignation to the
divine will.</p>
<p>To consider his character in the domestic relation of a
master, it is proper to remark, that as his habitual meekness and
command of his passions prevented indecent sallies of
ungovernable anger towards those in a state of subjection to him,
so the natural <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>greatness of his mind made him solicitous to render
their inferior stations as easy as he could: he had also such a
sense of the dignity and worth of an immortal soul, as engaged
him to give his servants frequent religious exhortations and
instructions.</p>
<p>To consider him in his military character, his bravery was as
remarkable in the field of battle, as his milder virtues in the
domestic circle: and he was particularly careful to prevent the
various duties of religion and his profession from interfering
with one another either in himself or others.&nbsp; He therefore
abhorred every thing that should look like a contrivance to keep
the soldiers employed about their horses and their arms at the
season of public worship: far from that, he used to have them
drawn up just before it began, and from the parade they went off
to the house of God; where they behaved with as much reverence,
gravity, and decorum, during the time of divine service, as any
of their fellow-worshippers.</p>
<p>That this remarkable care to maintain good discipline among
them might be the more effectual, he made himself on all
occasions accessible to them, and expressed a great concern for
their interest, temporal as well as spiritual; yet he had all the
firmness requisite to the infliction of punishment where he
judged it necessary.</p>
<p>We may notice one instance of his conduct which happened at
Leicester.&nbsp; While part of his regiment was encamped in that
neighbourhood, the Colonel went <i>incognito</i> to the camp in
the middle of the night; for sometimes he lodged at his quarters
in the town.&nbsp; One of the sentinels had abandoned his post,
and, on being seized, broke out into some oaths and profane
execrations against those that discovered him&mdash;a crime of
which the Colonel had the greatest abhorrence, and on which he
never failed to animadvert.&nbsp; The man afterwards appeared
much ashamed and concerned for what he had done; but <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the Colonel
ordered him to be brought up early the next morning to his own
quarters, where he had prepared a piquet, on which he appointed
him a private sort of penance; and while he was put upon it, he
discoursed with him seriously and tenderly upon the evils and
aggravations of his fault; admonishing him of the divine
displeasure which he had incurred; and then urged him to argue
upon the pain which he then felt, how infinitely more dreadful it
must be to &ldquo;fall into the hands of the living God,&rdquo;
and to meet the terrors of that damnation which he had been
accustomed impiously to call upon himself and his
companions.&nbsp; The result of this proceeding was, that the
offender accepted his punishment, not only with submission, but
with thankfulness; and spoke of it some years after in such a
manner that there seemed reason to hope it had been instrumental
in producing a change in his heart, as well as in his life.</p>
<p>Indeed, this excellent officer always expressed the greatest
reverence of the name of the blessed God; and endeavoured to
suppress, and, if possible to extirpate that detestable sin of
swearing and cursing, which is every where so common, and
especially among our military men.&nbsp; He often declared his
sentiments with respect to this enormity at the head of the
regiment, and urged his captains and their subalterns to take the
greatest care that they did not give the sanction of their
example to that, which by their office they were obliged to
punish in others.&nbsp; His zeal on these occasions wrought in a
very active, and sometimes in a remarkably successful manner,
among not only his equals, but his superiors too.</p>
<p>Nor was his character less conspicuous than his zeal.&nbsp;
The lively and tender feelings of his heart engaged him to
dispense his bounties with a liberal hand: and above all, his
sincere and ardent love to the Lord Jesus Christ, led him to
feel, with a true sympathy, the concerns of his poor
members.&nbsp; In <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>consequence of this he honoured several of his friends
with commissions for the relief of the poor; and esteemed it an
honour which Providence conferred upon him, that he should be
made the Lord&rsquo;s almoner for the relief of such.</p>
<p>That heroic contempt of death which had often discovered
itself in the midst of former dangers, was manifested now in his
discourse with several of his most intimate friends.&nbsp; And as
he had in former years often expressed a desire, &ldquo;that if
it were the will of God, he might have some honourable call to
sacrifice his life in defence of religion and the liberties of
his country:&rdquo; so, when it appeared to him most probable
that he might be called to it immediately, he met the summons
with the greatest readiness.&nbsp; This appears from a letter
which he wrote only eight days before his death: &ldquo;The
rebels,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are advancing to cross the Firth;
but I trust in the Almighty God, who doeth whatsoever he pleaseth
in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These sentiments wrought in him to the last in the most
effectual manner.&nbsp; But he was ordered to march as fast as
possible to Dunbar; and that hasty retreat, in concurrence with
the news which they soon after received of the surrender of
Edinburgh to the rebels, struck a visible panic into both the
regiments of dragoons.&nbsp; This affected the Colonel so much,
that, on Thursday before the fatal action at Preston-pans, he
intimated to an officer of considerable rank, that he expected
the event would be as in fact it proved; and to a person who
visited him, he said, &ldquo;I cannot influence the conduct of
others as I could wish, but I have one life to sacrifice to my
country&rsquo;s safety, and I shall not spare it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday, Sept. 20, 1745, (the day before the battle which
transmitted him to his immortal crown,) when the whole army was
drawn up about noon, the Colonel rode through all the ranks of
his own <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>regiment, addressing them at once in the most respectful
and animating manner, both as soldiers and as Christians, to
engage them to exert themselves courageously in the service of
their country, and to neglect nothing that might have a tendency
to prepare them for whatever event might happen.&nbsp; They
seemed much affected with the address, and expressed a very
ardent desire of attacking the enemy immediately&mdash;a desire
in which he and another gallant officer of distinguished
character would gladly have gratified them, if it had been in the
power of either; but they were overruled; and he spent the
remainder of the day in making as good a disposition as
circumstances would allow.</p>
<p>He continued all night under arms, wrapped up in his cloak,
and sheltered under a rick of barley which happened to be in the
field.&nbsp; About three in the morning he called his domestic
servants to him, of whom there were four in waiting.&nbsp; He
dismissed three of them with most affectionate Christian advice,
and such solemn charges relative to the performance of their
duty, and care of their souls, as seemed plainly to intimate that
he apprehended, at least very probably, he was taking his last
farewell of them.&nbsp; There is great reason to believe that he
spent the little remainder of time, which could not be much above
an hour, in those devout exercises of soul, which had so long
been habitual to him.&nbsp; The army was alarmed at break of day
by a noise of the rebels&rsquo; approach, and the attack was made
before sunrise.&nbsp; As soon as the enemy came within gun-shot,
they commenced a furious fire; and the dragoons, which
constituted the left wing, immediately fled.&nbsp; The Colonel,
at the beginning of the attack, which in the whole lasted but a
few minutes, received a bullet in his left breast, which made him
give a sudden spring in his saddle; upon which his servant, who
had led the horse, would have persuaded him to retreat; but he
said it was only a wound in the flesh, and fought <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>on, though he
presently received a shot in the right thigh.&nbsp; The Colonel
was, for a few moments, supported by his men, and particularly
about fifteen dragoons, who stood by him to the last.&nbsp; But
after a faint fire, the regiment in general was seized with a
panic; and though the Colonel and some gallant officers did what
they could to rally them once or twice, they at last took a
precipitate flight.&nbsp; Just in the moment when Colonel
Gardiner seemed to be making a pause, to deliberate what duty
required him to do in such a circumstance, he saw a party of the
foot who were then bravely fighting near him, but had no officer
to head them; upon which he rode up to them immediately, and
cried out aloud, &ldquo;Fire on, my lads, and fear
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; But just as the words were out of his
mouth, a Highlander advanced to him with a scythe fastened to a
long pole, with which he gave him such a deep wound on his right
arm, that his sword dropped out of his hand; and at the same
time, several others coming about him while he was thus
dreadfully entangled with that cruel weapon, he was dragged from
off his horse.&nbsp; The moment he fell another Highlander gave
him a stroke, either with a broadsword, or a Lochaber axe, on the
head, which was the mortal blow.&nbsp; All that his faithful
attendant saw further at this time was, that as his hat was
falling off, he took it in his left hand, and waved it as a
signal to him to retreat, adding, (which were the last words he
ever heard him speak,) &ldquo;Take care of yourself:&rdquo; upon
which the servant immediately fled to a mill, at the distance of
about two miles from the spot on which the Colonel fell; where he
changed his dress, and, disguised like a miller&rsquo;s servant,
returned with a cart about two hours after the engagement.&nbsp;
The hurry of the action was then pretty well over, and he found
his much-honoured master not only plundered of his watch and
other things of value, but also stripped of his upper garments
and boots, yet still breathing; <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and adds, that though he was not
capable of speech, yet, on taking him up, he opened his eyes,
which makes it something questionable whether he were altogether
insensible.&nbsp; In this condition, and in this manner, he
conveyed him to the church of Tranent, whence he was immediately
taken into the minister&rsquo;s house and laid in a bed; where he
continued breathing till about eleven in the forenoon, when he
took his final leave of pain and sorrow.&nbsp; His remains were
interred the Tuesday following, Sept. 24, at the parish church of
Tranent (where he had usually attended divine service) with great
solemnity.</p>
<p class="poetry">When God reveal&rsquo;d his gracious name,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chang&rsquo;d my mournful state,<br />
My rapture seem&rsquo;d a pleasing dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grace appear&rsquo;d so great.</p>
<p class="poetry">The world beheld the glorious change,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And did thy hand confess;<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
